    "# How close was the 2020 US Presidential Election?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Electoral College\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often said that the US Presidential Election system, especially the [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) mechanism, is a bad system. In summary, the Electoral College is the part of the process where the vote of each states are translated to a number of \"electors\", vaguely proportional to the population of the state, who performs a second turn of voting whose result will actually decide the result of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common issues with the Electoral College includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most states use a \"winner-take-all\" system, which can discourage voters of states where the outcome is known in advance\n",
    "- The number of electors of each state is not exactly proportional to the population of each state, giving an artificial advantage to some states\n",
    "- The popular vote winner may not be the actual winner, even with a significant majority. This is not a trivial quirk of the system, as it already happened twice this century (as of 2021).\n",
    "- More than 3 million people in the [US Territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States) cannot vote to elect their leader\n",
    "\n",
    "The following assumes that the reader has a basic grasp on the working of the Electoral College mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Election result stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we introduce a new concept (or a not-new concept, I'm not a social choice theory expert), called **election result stability** and defined as *the minimal number of voters that would have to change their vote to change the result of an election*. It is expressed as a percentage of the total number of voters (excluding spoiled ballots and \"None of the above\"-type votes).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the second round of the [2017 French election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_French_presidential_election):\n",
    "- Emmanuel Macron won with 66.1% ($V_{M}$) of the vote\n",
    "- Marine Le Pen lost with 33.9% ($V_{LP}$) of the vote\n",
    "\n",
    "So the election result stability $S$ would trivially be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = \\frac{V_{M} - V_{LP}}{2} = 16.1\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "and indeed, we see that $V_{LP} + S = 50\\%$, the score needed to overturn the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this example seems extremely simple, it's because the French presidential election, while not perfect, uses a system that is actually sane and produces a result that is clear for everyone to understand and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, let's return to the US Presidential Election."

    "## Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we concentrate on the [2020 US Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election), won by Joe Biden over Donald Trump by an Electoral College victory of 321-306 (margin: 25) and, anecdotally, by a popular vote victory of 51%-47% (margin: 4%). We will answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is the election result stability of the election?\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in other words\n",
    "\n",
    "> How many voters changing their vote would be sufficient to reverse the election?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a surprisingly hard question to answer, as we can imagine a number of different scenarios where the results would be overturned (e.g. California voting for Trump for some reason), but each of them would require a different number of voters changing their vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify our analysis, we make a few hypotheses:\n",
    "- Consider 3rd party voters as spoiled ballots (sorry to Jo Jorgensen, the only female presidential candidate ðŸ˜¬)\n",
    "- Consider \"None of the Above\" voters as spoiled ballots\n",
    "- No faithless electors (the result of the electoral college will be correctly translated in the second turn)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the first two hypotheses make our model simpler, but won't affect the result as the quickest path to change the election is converting Biden voters to Trump voters anyway)\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, let's get our hands dirty With that being said, let's get our hands dirty ðŸ™Œ"

    "\n",
    "An interesting further work would be to compute the opposite value, the \"inversed stability\", i.e. the maximal number of voters that can change their vote without overturning the election. Because of the electoral college quirkyness, this number will probably be laughably huge. Note that in a sane system (e.g. the French election discussed above), the stability and the inversed stability would be equal.\n",
